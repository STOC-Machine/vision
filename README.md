# Drone Vision

*Because you really shouldn't be flying blind*

This is a repository for the drone's computer vision module. The goal of this project is to create a program that can be fed a video stream from the done, and allow it to:

* Locate itself in the play area
* Locate the little robots 
* (Optional) Locate other flying drones

It is currently using [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/) with Python as a start.

# What the grid looks like

*A  square  arena  is  marked  on  the  ground in an indoor GPS-free arena.  This square arena will be 20 meters on each side.  The boundary  shall  consist  of  wide  white  lines bounding the sides of the square arena, with a wide red line on one end, and a wide green line on the other end as shown in the figure*

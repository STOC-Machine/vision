# Drone Vision

*Because you really shouldn't be flying blind*

This is a repository for the drone's computer vision module. The goal of this project is to create a program that can be fed a video stream from the done, and allow it to:

* Locate itself in the play area
* Locate the little robots 
* (Optional) Locate other flying drones

It is currently using [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/) with Python as a start.
